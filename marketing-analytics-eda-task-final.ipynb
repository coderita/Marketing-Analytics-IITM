Therefore, people who spent an above average amount on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test\n* Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain. Accordingly, do \"Married PhD candidates\" have a significant relation with amount spent on fish? What other factors are significantly related to amount spent on fish?
